This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to run this React app locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   Launch the app in development mode:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

4. **View the app**

   The app should now be running locally. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the app in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
